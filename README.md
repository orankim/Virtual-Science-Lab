Exploring Input Devices for Supporting Virtual Magnet Experiments for Third Grade Students

### Unity Version
* 2020.3.7f1.

### Input Device
* Keyboard
* Vive Pro Eye Controller
* Leap Motion

### Output Device
* Monitor

### Three Tasks
* Task 1
 * Goal : to move the magnet that is placed between the objects and identify which object is magnetic.
 * The presented objects differed between the devices.
* Task 2
 * Goal : to understand the relationship between an object's mass and the magnetic force.
 * Move the magnet slowly to the left.
 * Repeat twice with a ball each, which differed in its mass.
* Task 3
 * Goal : to understand the relationship between the number of magnets and the total magnetic force.
 * Wait for 5 seconds then connect both magnets and observe the ball's movement to identify which case has the higher magnetic force.
